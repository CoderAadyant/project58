        My favorite hobby is reading books. I read fun mystery stories. My favorite type of books are mystery. Right now my favorite book/series is Diary of a Wimpy Kid. It's about this kid name Greg who goes to middle shcool. He writes in his diary (which is the book) everyday. His family has crazy adventrues and they all live a crazy life. The aouthor of Diary of the Wimpy Kid is Jeff Kiney. DIary of a WImpy Kid is a realy good series and i have really fun reading and it keeps me busy.
